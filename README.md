Arduino and Raspberry Pi

-- UNDER CONSTRUCTION --

If you want to set up and use your Arduino R4 WIFI with Arduino Cloud, this Youtube video does an excellent job of walking you through the whole process:

Code and notes for the following projects are in their respective directories.

Project 1: Temperature and humidity

This project uses an Arduino R4 WIFI board and a temp/humidity sensor to send data to the Arduino Cloud.

Project 2: Air pressure

This projects uses a Raspberry Pi 400 and a temperature/humidity/air pressure sensor. We are only interested in the pressure data here. It is saved to the Arduino Cloud.

Project 3: Display tempurature and humidity on LCD panel

This project was purposely made more complex in order to learn API communications with another device (in this case the Raspberry PI 400).
