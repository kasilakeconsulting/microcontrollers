This project uses a Raspberry Pi 400, a Sparkfun Qwiic pHAT Extension, and a SparkFun Atmospheric Sensor Breakout - BME280.

Every 60 seconds the timestamp and values are saved in a CSV file on an SD drive.

It also saves the values to the Arduino Cloud! You can use the cloud to create a dashboard for it.
